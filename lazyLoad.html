  <h1>Solar system</h1>

  <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that
    orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly,
    the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects,
    such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
    Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons,
    two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>

  <p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
    interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most
    of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus,
    Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal.
    The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
    The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium;
    the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants,
    being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen
    and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.
    All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>

        <h1>Sun</h1>

  <p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component.
    Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) produces temperatures and densities in its core
    high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star.
     This releases an enormous amount of energy,
    mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.</p>

  <h1>Mercury</h1>

  <p>Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet
    in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses).
    Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features
    are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in
    its history.[67] Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its
    surface by the solar wind.[68] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet
    been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a
    giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.</p>
